        "#### Whether you or your advisor are ready to admit it, being a modern scientist means being a software developer. Few of our mentors are able to mentor coders effectively. After 70 years of computer science there is a lot of wisdom for you to apply, but it lies elsewhere. Much of this wisdom is surprising and appears to contradict common prejudices about the scientific method. This is because computational data analysis tactics are prolific and have many parts that are sensitively connected. It's up to you to adapt it appropriately and give it to your peers. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### The overwhelming consensus about the best way to be quick, creative, curious, and contented is to heed the \"Agile\" philosophy.\n",
        "## Agile Philosophy \n",
        "\n",
        "#### The observation which drove the development of \"agile\" is that when you need to develop software it requires too much fiddling and on-the-spot problem solving to be planned for with rigid preconceptions. Try to study everything and make a plan in advance and you will eventually succeed, but at a higher cost and with more lost opportunities than you realize.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why focus a discussion of scientific analysis on Agile\n",
        "\n",
        "1.\tAgile emphasizes speed but improves learning, understanding, and quality, even though it’s all jumping into things without lengthy pre-analysis. It’s so rapid you may feel like an imposter, despite doing well. Therefore, it’s a great introduction to ways to manage your projects in grad school where your projects are half your life.  \n",
        "    a. When a normal student gets the same result as the *fastest* student the faster student did it about 10X faster on average.

Even the US-DoD adopted then abandoned waterfall. Waterfall is intuitive and agile is counter-intuitive but more effective (for western educated people anyway). This helps me discuss dos and don’ts, without nagging or making readers feel isolated.   \n",

        "### Agile is summarized with a brief manifesto which I've translated for the PhD student researcher:\n",
        "**Individuals and interactions over protocols and organization tools** Have regular discussions about your progress rather than maintaining a strict schedule or believing in time-management tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Working analysis and data visualization over precise structure and methods explication** Focus on useful and interpretable plots that are easy to generate and communicate, rather than painstakingly structuring the analysis and explaining every step.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advisor collaboration over promises and stated limitations** Get your advisor/mentor to sit down at your computer and look at your data so that you can rapidly demonstrate things, rather than exclusively meeting with limited slides or whiteboard work and making promises or naming obstacles. You'll get more useful insights, and they'll understand more but change might be hard. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Responding to insight over following a plan** Data analysis projects are actually dozens of smaller algorithmic experiments nested inside of a larger scientific experiment. All that matters is that you have eliminated alternative hypotheses, leave the algorithms out of your pre-conceived protocol. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## All modern scientists are software developers?...Really?\n",
        "\n",
        "Not all software developers write code, some are bosses. So in that sense yes. It's not clear how many scientific papers published last year required someone to write at least one line of code, it's probably >99.9%. Most research papers involved the use of custom code for data analysis and plotting. Senior researchers who don't write any lines of code are leading projects where many lines of code are written and that code is as important to favorable outcomes as the quality of the data itself. That code is becoming increasingly complex. Waiting for someone to develop a slick software tool with a GUI (like LabView) for everything is futile. Too many tools are being developed too fast, and the data formats are too diverse. For the foreseeable future (~10 years) a research group depending on GUI software will always be behind (AI might change this).\n",
        "\n",
        "The proliferation of code in science has created reproducibility problems. We scientists write awful code, it's kludgy, poorly documented, and is full of idiosyncrasies. Agile won't fix that unless it's your goal to fix that. **The broader point is that, for now, you are a coder and need advice intended for coders. By pulling the thread that is Agile you unravel that advice.** \n",

        "\n",
        "*\tLose the habit of planning every detail of your project in advance  \n",
        "    *\tDo your project in “drafts” AKA “sprints”. Do the project by redoing it over and over, learning what details matter as you go. Plan your next few days only. The only whole-project plan should be a list of flexible goals and standards for success.  \n",
        "    *\tDo create a data management plan.  \n",
        "    *\tDo keep a journal of some kind.  \n",
        "*\tReject the common prejudice that you need to study project related concepts in depth before jumping in.  \n",
        "    *\tPractice “just in time” learning. Attempt each “sprint” with only knowledge you can gain quickly and easily. With each draft of your project you’ll have more new things to study. Your knowledge from previous drafts will have settled, and you’ll be able to comprehend increasingly difficult texts and concepts. This is also “spaced repetition”.  \n",
        "    *\tDo master basic coding best practices and use test-based development.  \n",
        "* Don't convince yourself that methods won't work just because you tried and failed.\n",
        "    * You don't know what information is actually in the data -> You don't know what's impossible.\n",
        "    * You don't know how the information is represented. -> You don't know what tweaks you need.\n",
        "    * Run a lot of scripts in parallel, try many things but keep focused on using insights from yours and your colleague's knowledge about the experiment where the data was collected. Grouping data, detrending data, dimensionality reduction/expansion, filtering, event detection, etc. \n",
        "    * Decide to abandon approaches based on the time you wish to spend, not because you rationalized the worthlessness of an approach. \n",
        "* Conduct your literature review phase by collecting a lot of papers about the methods you want to employ but only read them as you need them. If a paper is really interesting, feel free of course. \n",
        "* Don't work alone. If you don't have a team, create one. Maybe look outside your lab, I use forums, and friends. We should probably start a \"research partners personal ads\" for the WashU system. \n",
        "    * You need people with knowledge and or experience to direct you to better information. Try to avoid those who offer dogmatic constraints.\n",
        "    * Don't expect hands on help unless it's an official relationship or you are willing to offer help in return.\n",
        "    * Check in with someone, anyone, regularly about what you did this day, and this week. Preferably this is a colleague, but anyone who knows you can tell you when you're too rigid, or too mired in details. \n",
        "* Reject the common habit of \"summative\" reports to your advisor (conclusions focused).  \n",
        "    * Present intermediate results rather than pressuring yourself for conclusions. As the group becomes aware of the realities of the data, goals may change. It's awful to do a lot of work that doesn't get used. \n",
        "    * If you present at a meeting every week, make it the story of your week (if your advisor resists, you can find a middle ground). Focus meetings on deciding what works/doesn't work, and what needs to be changed or accomplished next week. \n",
        "* **Don't do anything like this**:  \n",

Agile gives you a mindset prepared for tackling problems like this and an alternative way to express pride and perfectionism. The iterative aspect gives you a natural way to learn what you need to while making tangible progress from the start and refining ad nauseum. The collaboration and communicative aspects give a natural way to constrain your explorations and find the right information.\n",

So, you will often feel unqualified for the next steps. As a new scientist, you'll become qualified for each iteration at the very end and then it's time for the next. If you reject Agile and try to learn everything in advance, it will take you a long time and you will not have all the cognitive associations needed to recall information at the right time anyway.

Furthermore, as a PhD student everything around you is new to you personally. It's common to feel like you don't belong. If you feel that way you are right! Few people ever make it far enough to do scientific research because it is very hard. Nobody belongs here! The complexion of science is constantly changing.
