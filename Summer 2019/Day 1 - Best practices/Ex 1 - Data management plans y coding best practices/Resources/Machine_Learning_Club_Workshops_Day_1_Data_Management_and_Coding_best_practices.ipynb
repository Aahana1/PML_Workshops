Still, since it’ll be ignored at runtime and won’t appear in the bytecode, it can effectively act as a comment. (You can take a look at [this article](https://dbader.org/blog/python-multiline-comment) for proof that these strings won’t show up in the bytecode.)\n",
        "\n",
        "However, be careful where you place these multiline “comments.” Depending on where they sit in your program, they could turn into docstrings, which are pieces of documentation that are associated with a function or method. If you slip one of these bad boys right after a function definition, then what you intended to be a comment will become associated with that object.\n",

        "\n",
        "## When Writing Code for Yourself\n",
        "\n",
        "You can make life easier for yourself by commenting your own code properly. Even if no one else will ever see it, you’ll see it, and that’s enough reason to make it right. You’re a developer after all, so your code should be easy for you to understand as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "One extremely useful way to use comments for yourself is as an outline for your code. If you’re not sure how your program is going to turn out, then you can use comments as a way to keep track of what’s left to do, or even as a way of tracking the high-level flow of your program. For instance, use comments to outline a function in pseudo-code:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from collections import defaultdict\n",
        "\n",
        "def get_top_cities(prices):\n",
        "    top_cities = defaultdict(int)\n",
        "\n",
        "    # For each price range\n",
        "    # Get city searches in that price\n",

        "    return dict(top_cities)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "These comments plan out `get_top_cities()``. Once you know exactly what you want your function to do, you can work on translating that to code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using comments like this can help keep everything straight in your head. As you walk through your program, you’ll know what’s left to do in order to have a fully functional script. After “translating” the comments to code, remember to remove any comments that have become redundant so that your code stays crisp and clean.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can also use comments as part of the debugging process. Comment out the old code and see how that affects your output. If you agree with the change, then don’t leave the code commented out in your program, as it decreases readability. Delete it and use version control if you need to bring it back.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, **use comments to define tricky parts of your own code. If you put a project down and come back to it months or years later, you’ll spend a lot of time trying to get reacquainted with what you wrote.** In case you forget what your own code does, do Future You a favor and mark it down so that it will be easier to get back up to speed later on.\n",

        "Be nice to your fellow devs and use comments to help them skim through your code. Inline comments should be used sparingly to clear up bits of code that aren’t obvious on their own.

        "Another good way to practice is to go back and review old code that you’ve written. See where anything might not make sense, and clean up the code. If it still needs some extra support, add a quick comment to help clarify the code’s purpose.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is an especially good idea if your code is up on GitHub and people are forking your repo. Help them get started by guiding them through what you’ve already done.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can also give back to the community by commenting other people’s code. If you’ve downloaded something from GitHub and had trouble sifting through it, add comments as you come to understand what each piece of code does.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Sign” your comment with your initials and the date, and then submit your changes as a pull request. If your changes are merged, you could be helping dozens if not hundreds of developers like yourself get a leg up on their next project.\n",
