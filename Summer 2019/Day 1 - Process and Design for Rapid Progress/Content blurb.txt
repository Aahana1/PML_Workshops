ML in a nutshell (it all boils down to optimization). 

Data management: 
Folder structure, record keeping, naming schemes, and juggling multiple versions. 
Coding practices: 
Where to learn, what to learn, not getting confused or forgetting what's next, remembering what your code does, and sharing it with others. 
Designing your project: 
Avoiding bias, learning from previous generation's mistakes (Agile), picking resources and techniques, judging the time required.
Topics to cover: 
Python (Anaconda). Understanding object oriented languages and dynamic programming in Keras and Tensorflow. Parallel and GPU computing, cloud computing, wild computing concepts (reservoir computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic computing, and bio-computing). Where does statistics end and Machine Learning begin? When does Machine Learning become AI? 

The first rule of ML: 
Know when not to use ML.
