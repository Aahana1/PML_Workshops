        "Sub-second temporal-resolution tomographic microscopy is becoming a reality at third-generation synchrotron sources. Efficient data handling and post-processing is, however, difficult when the data rates are close to 10 GB s(-1). This bottleneck still hinders exploitation of the full potential inherent in the ultrafast acquisition speed. In this paper the fast reconstruction algorithm gridrec, highly optimized for conventional CPU technology, is presented. It is shown that gridrec is a valuable alternative to standard filtered back-projection routines, despite being based on the Fourier transform method. In fact, the regridding procedure used for resampling the Fourier space from polar to Cartesian coordinates couples excellent performance with negligible accuracy degradation. The stronger dependence of the observed signal-to-noise ratio for gridrec reconstructions on the number of angular views makes the presented algorithm even superior to filtered back-projection when the tomographic problem is well sampled. Gridrec not only guarantees high-quality results but it provides up to 20-fold performance increase, making real-time monitoring of the sub-second acquisition process a reality.\n",

        "Algebraic reconstruction techniques for tomography are based on a straightforward idea: for a pixelated image the value of a single ray in a particular projection is simply a sum of all the pixels the ray passes through on its way through the object. This is a way of expressing the forward Radon transform. The inverse Radon transform can then be formulated as a (large) set of linear equations. As each ray passes through a small fraction of the pixels in the image, this set of equations is sparse, allowing iterative solvers for sparse linear systems to tackle the system of equations. One iterative method has been particularly popular, namely Kaczmarz’ method 3, which has the property that the solution will approach a least-squares solution of the equation set.\n",
        "\n",
        "The combination of the formulation of the reconstruction problem as a set of linear equations and an iterative solver makes algebraic techniques relatively flexible, hence some forms of prior knowledge can be incorporated with relative ease.\n",
        "\n",
        "skimage provides one of the more popular variations of the algebraic reconstruction techniques: the Simultaneous Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (SART). It uses Kaczmarz’ method 3 as the iterative solver. A good reconstruction is normally obtained in a single iteration, making the method computationally effective. Running one or more extra iterations will normally improve the reconstruction of sharp, high frequency features and reduce the mean squared error at the expense of increased high frequency noise (the user will need to decide on what number of iterations is best suited to the problem at hand. The implementation in skimage allows prior information of the form of a lower and upper threshold on the reconstructed values to be supplied to the reconstruction."
